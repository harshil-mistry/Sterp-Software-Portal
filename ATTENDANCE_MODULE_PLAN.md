PART 9: BUSINESS LOGIC
==========================================

ATTENDANCE RULES:

3. Cannot mark attendance twice same day
4. Can checkout anytime after check-in
5. Admin can override any record

WORK HOURS CALCULATION:
work_hours = checkout_time - checkin_time
Example: 6:00 PM - 9:00 AM = 9 hours

STATUS DETERMINATION:
if checkin_time > 9:15 AM: status = LATE
elif checkout_time - checkin_time < 4 hours: status = HALF_DAY
elif no checkout: status = PENDING
else: status = PRESENT

ATTENDANCE RATE:
attendance_rate = (present_days / total_working_days) * 100
