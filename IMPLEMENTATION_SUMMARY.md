## 📦 What Was Built

### Database Layer (3 New Models)
1. **LeaveType** - Master table for leave categories
   - Fields: name, description, default_days

2. **LeaveBalance** - Tracks per-employee per-year balances
   - Fields: employee, leave_type, year, total_days, used_days, remaining_days
   - Auto-calculates remaining_days on save
   - Unique constraint: (employee, leave_type, year)

3. **LeaveApplication** - Leave requests with approval workflow
   - Fields: employee, leave_type, start_date, end_date, total_days, reason
   - Status: PENDING → APPROVED/REJECTED/CANCELLED
   - Tracks: reviewed_by, reviewed_at, admin_remarks
   - Methods: approve(), reject(), clean() for validation

### Forms (1 New Form)
- **LeaveApplicationForm** - Employee-facing application form
  - Validates date ranges (end >= start)
  - Checks leave balance before submission
  - Auto-calculates total_days
  - Dark theme styled with Tailwind

### Views (9 New Views)

## 🔒 Business Logic

### Leave Application Flow
```
1. Employee fills form → Validates dates & balance
2. Submits application → Status: PENDING
3. Admin reviews → Sees balance info
4. Admin approves → 
   - Status: APPROVED
   - Balance automatically deducted
   - reviewed_by & reviewed_at set
5. OR Admin rejects →
   - Status: REJECTED
   - Balance unchanged
   - Mandatory remarks required
```

### Balance Calculation
```python
remaining_days = total_days - used_days

# On approval:
used_days += application.total_days
remaining_days = total_days - used_days  # Auto-calculated
```

### Validation Rules
- End date must be >= Start date
- Must have sufficient balance before applying
- Total days = (end_date - start_date) + 1 (inclusive)
- Only PENDING applications can be cancelled
- Only PENDING applications can be approved/rejected
- Rejection requires admin remarks

## 📊 Database Schema

```sql
-- LeaveType
id, name, description, default_days, created_at, updated_at

-- LeaveBalance
id, employee_id, leave_type_id, year, total_days, used_days, remaining_days

-- LeaveApplication
id, employee_id, leave_type_id, start_date, end_date, total_days, 
reason, status, reviewed_by_id, reviewed_at, admin_remarks, 
created_at, updated_at
```

## ✅ Testing Checklist

See `TESTING_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive testing steps.

**Quick Smoke Test:**
1. Login as employee → Apply for 3-day casual leave
2. Login as admin → Approve the leave
3. Login as employee → Check balance (should be 4 remaining)
4. Apply for 10-day casual leave → Should fail (insufficient)

## 🎓 Technical Decisions

### Why Signals?
- Ensures new employees always have balances
- Decoupled from form logic
- Automatic and consistent

### Why Auto-calculate remaining_days?
- Single source of truth
- Prevents data inconsistency
- Updates automatically on save

### Why Approve/Reject Methods?
- Encapsulates business logic
- Ensures proper status transitions
- Validates before updating

### Why Modal for Approve/Reject?
- Prevents accidental clicks
- Allows optional/required remarks
- Better UX than separate pages

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### High Priority
- [ ] Email notifications (application, approval, rejection)
- [ ] Leave calendar view (visual timeline)
- [ ] Year-end rollover logic

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Half-day leave support
- [ ] Leave type per department customization
- [ ] Public holiday integration
- [ ] Leave reports (CSV/PDF export)

### Low Priority
- [ ] Leave delegation (apply on behalf)
- [ ] Leave overlap detection/warnings
- [ ] Mobile app integration
- [ ] Leave forecasting/analytics

---

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues
1. **New employee has no balances**
   - Check if signal is registered in apps.py
   - Verify LeaveType records exist
   - Check logs for errors

2. **Balance not deducting on approval**
   - Verify approve() method is called
   - Check LeaveBalance save() method
   - Look for exceptions in logs

3. **Form validation failing**
   - Check date formats
   - Verify LeaveBalance exists for that type/year
   - Check employee parameter in form init

### Monitoring
- Check `users/signals.py` logs for auto-assignment
- Monitor `LeaveApplication.approve()` for balance updates
- Track `LeaveBalance.remaining_days` for accuracy
