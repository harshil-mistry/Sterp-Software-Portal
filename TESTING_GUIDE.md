---

## Database Tests

  4. Check balance again
- **Expected**:

  - Used=3
  - Remaining=4
  - Calculation: remaining_days = total_days - used_days

## Quick Test Script

```python
# Django shell test
python manage.py shell

from users.models import Employee, LeaveType, LeaveBalance, LeaveApplication
from datetime import date, timedelta

# Get a test employee
emp = Employee.objects.filter(is_superuser=False).first()

# Check balances
balances = LeaveBalance.objects.filter(employee=emp, year=2025)
for b in balances:
    print(f"{b.leave_type.name}: {b.remaining_days}/{b.total_days}")

# Create test application
casual = LeaveType.objects.get(name="Casual Leave")
app = LeaveApplication.objects.create(
    employee=emp,
    leave_type=casual,
    start_date=date.today() + timedelta(days=5),
    end_date=date.today() + timedelta(days=7),
    total_days=3,
    reason="Test application",
    status='PENDING'
)
print(f"Created application #{app.id}")

# Simulate approval
admin = Employee.objects.filter(is_superuser=True).first()
app.approve(admin=admin, remarks="Approved for testing")
print(f"Approved! New balance: {balances.get(leave_type=casual).remaining_days}")
```
